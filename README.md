1. *Install Node.js*: Download and install Node.js from the official website [here](https://nodejs.org/).

2. *Verify Node.js Installation*: After installing Node.js, verify that it's installed correctly by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following commands:
   bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   

3. *Create a React App*: With Node.js installed, create a new React app using create-react-app. Replace my-app with the name of your app.
   bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   

4. *Navigate to Your App Directory*: Move into your newly created app's directory using the cd command.
   bash
   cd my-app
   

5. *Install Dependencies*: Install dependencies listed in the package.json file using npm.
   bash
   npm install
   

6. *Wait for Installation*: npm will fetch the dependencies and install them locally in a folder called node_modules.

7. *Verify Installation*: Check the node_modules directory in your project folder to ensure that the dependencies were installed successfully.



8. `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

9. Search something on the search bar , for example search "the lord" , it will show you the corresponding results and you can add the books to your book shelf .In my bookshelf you can see the books which you have added.







### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
